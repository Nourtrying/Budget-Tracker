# Budget-Tracker


This is my idea of a budget tracker.

At first I've only only implemented HTML, CSS and JS. and in the future I'm willing to develop the idea with using more technologies and adding more functionalities.

The idea of this project is a financial tracker, and the idea got inspired from a successful budget app called YNAB. The idea is to give every penny and job, fix your budget specify your priorities.
